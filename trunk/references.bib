  abstract = {{We present and evaluate an implementation of VAST (Voronoi- based
	Adaptive Scalable Transfer) as proposed by Shun-Yun Hu and Guan-Ming
	Liao in Scalable Peer-to-Peer Networked Virtual Environment [4].
	VAST is a fully-distributed peer-to-peer protocol, designed to handle
	event messages in MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games) and
	virtual worlds. VAST relies on voronoi diagrams and AOI (Areas Of
	Interest) for neighbor discovery. Benefits and problems of using
	voronoi diagrams in peer-to-peerbased MMOGs and virtual worlds are
	discussed, by looking at bandwidth usage, scalability and consistency
	of VAST and comparing it to other approaches. We point out certain
	issues regarding VASTs consistency and propose some changes to VASTs
	architecture aiming at enhancing its consistency. Finally we have
	a look at future extensions like group management and adaptive areas
	of interest per peer, in order to reduce bandwidth requirements and
	further increase VASTs consistency.}},

  abstract = {Over the Internet today, computing and communications environments
	are significantly more complex and chaotic than classical distributed
	systems, lacking any centralized organization or hierarchical control.
	There has been much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network
	overlays because they provide a good substrate for creating large-scale
	data sharing, content distribution, and application-level multicast
	applications. These P2P overlay networks attempt to provide a long
	list of features, such as: selection of nearby peers, redundant storage,
	efficient search/location of data items, data permanence or guarantees,
	hierarchical naming, trust and authentication, and anonymity. P2P
	networks potentially offer an efficient routing architecture that
	is self-organizing, massively scalable, and robust in the wide-area,
	combining fault tolerance, load balancing, and explicit notion of
	locality. In this article we present a survey and comparison of various
	Structured and Unstructured P2P overlay networks. We categorize the
	various schemes into these two groups in the design spectrum, and
	discuss the application-level network performance of each group.},
